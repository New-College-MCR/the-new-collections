# Introducing The New Collection

The New Collection is our annually published MCR journal. It is peer reviewed, ISSN-accredited, and accepts submissions from any field. It also has a non-peer reviewed section, focussing on topics of concern at New College. Last year, it focused on Equality and Diversity at New College. Feel free to go through previous issues of The New Collection on this page.
